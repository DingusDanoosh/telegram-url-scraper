Hello everyone
Good Evening
"Hi frens, good to see so many experts. WAGMI!"
"Hi,everyone looking forward to meet you guys😊"
Does metaverse needs blockchain. I donot think so. It is all about 3d modelling and graphics. Let me know your views.
"Yes it has to be decentralised, that’s the whole point, of no central authority taking control of it"
There can be private metaverse too. It's choice of the owner. My concern was whether it is technically feasible to make a ecom platform using metaverse architecture but not on any blockchain protocols.
Thanks for your reply
These few months I've been working and trying to figure out how can I use NFTS in real world Life scenarios.
"1. NFTs can be used as entry passes for events. Say this event can say anyone who proves to have 3 NFTs can get entry and some special passes
2. Digital certificates : for ownership or fractional ownership of an asset, the NFTs can be distributed 

3. Non transferable NFT like tokens : A system like this can be used issue course completion certificates or even for something like completing a marathon. This can be tied to one’s phone number or other aspects and attached a specific user and private key for ever."
You can check the above URL for a usecase that we are building on FileCoin itself.
Long detailed version with explanation here.

You will get tickets if you are approved so don't worry about that too

What's the best way to reach the venue from airport?
at airport there will KIA-XX buses. Ask them bus which is best suited to reach whitefield. They are AC and best in quality. little expensive compared to BMTC but worth every penny from a ride from a long journey!
and what about pg near Whitefield?
Will be expensive for sure

Might be wondering how we are different from all other Dapp Stores out their ? 
It has layers for interoperability, commerce, communication, programmable and identity - all to make web3 invisible for the end user. Our primary focus is to make onboarding and adoption really seamless for your users.

Would love to connect and see if you can leverage this for engaging and retaining users!

"Hey organizers I just wanted to give a suggession for the workshops.
Yesterday i attended the zk-Snark but I was sitting a bit behind. 
And the font on the screen was invisible. Also the sounds from other PODs were getting mixed up with each other.
I am sure others might have faced the same issue.

Instead of doing this way, we can ask the workshop holders to go live on YouTube there at the spot, and the link will be shared among those attending that workshop.
So participants can just plugin their earphones/headphones to their laptop or mobile and get clear audio and visual."

"['Hi all! Passing on an announcement from libp2p team:\n\nWebTransport is now enabled by default in Kubo (as of v0.18.0) and in go-libp2p. Current versions of js-libp2p (via the js-libp2p-webtransport module) also support it… so this is ready to be played with!\n\n👉 Check out this demo where Alex used WebTransport to fetch a file from Kubo (go-libp2p) directly from the browser (js-libp2p): ', {'type': 'link', 'text': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt42Ss6X_Vk'}, '\n\nWhy this matters for users:\n\nAs you can see, this unlocks a new paradigm of use cases for applications building on libp2p like:\n\nEnabling browser nodes (or light clients) as ""full"" peers in a decentralized network.\nUploading to Filecoin directly from the browser.\nGetting data from the DHT by directly connecting to a DHT server node.\nA little bit about the protocol 🤓:\n\nThe state of WebTransport (more about the state of WebTransport here):\n\nWebTransport is brand new and currently still in the specification phase (by the IETF and W3C).\nChrome already shipped support for one of the draft versions a few months back, and so did we. So libp2p is on the bleeding-edge! 🧛\nWhy it’s exciting for libp2p and why it’s better than old solutions (a lot more detail is available here):\n\nWebTransport finally allows us to eliminate the need for a TLS certificate. This was one of the biggest hurdles to the use of WebSocket in libp2p.\nMost libp2p nodes don’t have a valid TLS certificate (in fact, most of them don’t even have a domain name!)\nObtaining a certificate is hard to do in a decentralized manner. However, it’s a requirement for a browser node to connect with a WebSocket server, thus, we could never make WebSocket a default libp2p transport.\nHow does WebTransport do this you ask? 👇\n\nProtocol internals (more on how WebTransport works here):\n\nThe WebTransport browser API now (finally!) allows us to accept self-signed certificates.\nInstead of verifying the certificate chain, the browser will check that the SHA256 hash of the certificate matches the expected value. You’ll notice that WebTransport multiaddresses contain (one or multiple) certificate hashes, for example: /ip4/', {'type': 'link', 'text': '192.0.2.0/udp/1234/quic/webtransport/certhash/'}, '<hash>\nFurthermore, WebTransport runs on top of QUIC and allows browsers to establish stream-multiplexed connections to servers. It’s a bit like the WebSocket protocol, but over QUIC instead of TCP (or rather: over HTTP/3 instead of HTTP/1.1).\nIf you’d like to dive deep, please check out our blog post announcing WebTransport: ', {'type': 'link', 'text': 'https://blog.libp2p.io/2022-12-19-libp2p-webtransport/'}, '\n\nPlease let us know how it goes and what applications you’re planning to use WebTransport for. As always, you can reach out to us on IPFS Discord ', {'type': 'hashtag', 'text': '#libp2p'}, '-implementers ', {'type': 'link', 'text': 'https://discord.gg/ipfs'}, ' and we’ll be happy to help!']"

"Hey Folks!!

*Account Abstraction* is all the rage nowadays.

AA based wallets are far superior than EOA wallets when it comes to security, customisations and functionalities. Best part is that you don't even need seedphrase to create a self-custody wallet. 

*We are building a plug and play UI widget for dApps so that they can create smart wallets for their users*. Here are some functionalities of the widget 

- Ability to connect existing wallet or create a new smart wallet based on a login mechanism set by you

- ability for your users to see their complete portfolio and NFTs

- ability for your users to send,swap and receive tokens from the widget in your dApp

- Ability to sponsor your user's Gas fee, set withdrawal limits, take recurring or schedules payments

- JS based widget

- Ability for your users to use a proper wallet later on (obvious wallet)

Would love to know if anyone's interested in adding this as a super quick integration to their DApp or NFT collection. 

Game changer for Gaming, Simplified De-Fi space and NFT collections"
